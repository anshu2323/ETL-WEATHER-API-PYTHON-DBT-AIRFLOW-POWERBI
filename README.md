# ETL-WEATHER-API-PYTHON-DBT-AIRFLOW-POWERBI
In this data engineering project, we will learn how to build and automate an ETL process that can extract current weather data from open weather map API, transform the data using DBT and load the data into PowerBI using Apache Airflow as the orchestrator.
